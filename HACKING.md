# HACKING: Conventions and processes for contributing

## Merging strategy

If pairing, push straight to master.

If you are working solo, develop on a short lived branch and then either:

- Get an in person code review and push to master
- Submit a pull request (and maybe ask some people to review)

### What is a short lived branch?

Our branches should only last 1-3 days. Please take care to break up work into
sizable chunks and submit pull requests or get code reviews incrementally.
It shouldn't take more than an hour for someone to review your code/PR.

### What if nobody comments on my PR?

You should try and get other people to look at it. But if nobody has had a chance
to review it in two days, go ahead and merge it.

### Who reviews code?

Everybody! Please take some time whenever you sit down to work on the project
to check for any outstanding pull requests and review them. You definitely do
not have to wait for everyone to see your pull request before merging though.
